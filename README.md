# Open SQL DB
The TiemscaleDB and PostgreSQL databas. 




# Running the App
First, make sure that you edit the .env file. Remove the .example at the end and add your password in the .env file before you start. 

To start the docker container using Docker Compose run:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

To verify the container is running:
```
docker ps
```
you should see an entry called timescaledb container.

To connect to the Timescaledb container, run 
```
docker exec -it timescaledb psql -U postgres -d postgres
```

To run the .bat file use:
```
.\run-open-sql-db.bat
```


To Stop the container run 
```
docker stop timescaledb
docker rm timescaledb
```

For a compelte fresh start run
```
docker stop timescaledb
docker rm timescaledb
docker volume rm timescale_data
```


# How To Use


For now, you will have to manually set up your own solution if you want to use this yourself now. There will be a seperate repo with a sepreate container for mantaining data pipelines that will hanlde the data into this database. Note that there may be isntances where other repos will connect direclty to this one as well. 


# Purpose
This Timescale DB and PostgreSQL database will store orders, tickers, exchanges, asset types, OHLCV data, and more as we build more systems.


# Current Features
* Store data for exchanges, tickers, and asset type.
* Store OHLCV daily table using Timescale DB for better performance and scalability. 
* Docker container and .bat script for quick and easy setup.
